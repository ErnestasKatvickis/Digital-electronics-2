### Projects objectives

Project objective is to create description of 4x3 keyboard control and in this project must be included an application of door lock system, display, door unlock relay, own library for keypad scanning, time limit for entering the correct 4-digit code, signaling of entering the wrong code, time delay for re-locking the lock approx. Also, another project objectives are self study, creation of own solution and presentation of results.
