### Projects objectives

Project objective is to create description of 4x3 keyboard control and in this project must be included an application of door lock system, display, door unlock relay, own library for keypad scanning, time limit for entering the correct 4-digit code, signaling of entering the wrong code, time delay for re-locking the lock approx. Also, another project objectives are self study, creation of own solution and presentation of results.

## Hardware description

We used SimulIDE for our scheme. The scheme consist of
- LCD display - shows to the user the status of situation. If the password is written incorrectly then the word "Incorrect" lights up on LCD;; 
- AVR microcontroller Atmega328P - control the whole system;
- 4x3 keyboard - is used for the intput of the password;
- Audio output device - is used to inform about wrong password;
- Relay - is used to unlock the door;
- BJT transistor - is used as a switch;
- Fix voltage - used as a power source;
- LED's - here are Red and Green LED's. Red one signal that a wrong password was entered and the Green one signal that a right password was entered;
- Resistors;
- Grounds - is used to end the circuit.
